experience:
  - company: BG Automotive
    location: Swindon
    role: Software Engineer
    date_from: 2024-05
    date_to: Present
    points: 
      - Developed, deployed and maintained 10 containerized cloud applications optimized for resource efficiency, achieving reliable simultaneous operation on a single-core, low-tier cloud instance consuming less than 2 GB of memory running in parallel.
      # 1. BG Automotive's well-recognized Warranty site, which gained recognition during a company exhibition. 
      # - Implemented Cookie-based JWT authentication, permission groups, file serving, automated emails, and ERP integration to manage over 7,500 warranty claims and 1,000,000 GBP worth of products.
      #
      # 2. They were all written in Rust (God's intended language) as a *single* statically linked binary executable 
      #   (except for glibc libgcc, for that you'll need musl as a libc alternative)
      #   glibc = faster, musl = lighter
      #   ever heard of diet libc
      #
      # Rather than have two applications (frontend and backend):
      #   Compiled the svelte frontend statically and served it from the rust backend 
      #   All frontend files were compiled into the executable binary
      #
      # Static compilation step was scripted within the dockerfile
      #
      # Build artifacts were completely removed from the final image, 
      #
      # Produced a single statically linked, independent file 
      #   execute the file -> website served
      #
      # Tradeoff: hot reloading in development was mostly gone
      # 
      # - Learned to confgure DHCP to reserve IP addresses for 
      
      - Streamlined user experience by implementing stateless, secure authentication using `JWT`s stored in HTTP-only cookies, with access and refresh token rotation for session management.
      # Stateless: JWT
      # Secure: HTTP only, Samesite Lax|Strict, Secure, HTTPonly (no javascript access, requests only)
      # Session management: access + refresh tokens
      #
      # The JWT is just base64 encoded string
      # Try this experiment:
      #   - echo "$JWT" | awk -F. '{ print $1 $2 $3 }' | base64 -d | jq '.''
      # BGA warranty system: 
      #   - Authentication with JWTs, but no refresh tokens = frequent relogin OR login time is long + unbreakable
      #   - All JWTs were sent along with requests as 'Bearer token' headers (difficult implementation for every endpoint)
      #   - Cookies are just a mechanism to store a string, and that string being stored is a JWT
      # CSRF
      #   - local storage can just be accessed by any site
      #   - Samesite: None = Malicious website "evil.com" could have <img src="store.bga"> to force browser to send a request
      #   - Cookies (The SameSite header: Lax/Strict) solve CSRF (same domain only)

      - Implemented HTTP middleware in `Rust` using `Redis` as an intermediary write-back cache layer, Server-Sent Events, and frontend Virtualization/Windowing to handle payloads 600 times larger.
      # Middleware: intercepts requests and/or responses to apply something to them before reaching the handler
      # Redis = 400 times faster
      #   - 45s average -> 0.1s with caching
      #   - expiry date synchronized to 
      #
      # Virtualization/Windowing = 600 times larger
      #   - HTML was trying to render 40,000+ <tr> tags (n tags)
      #   - using the scrollY binding, made a dynamic slice of data which only renders what's visible
      #     - Games programming analogy: Frustum culling => don't render things that aren't on screen
      #   - Using this lazy rendering method we render a constant 50 rows + 2 growing/shrinking empty rows
      #     - Browser tries to render 2 enormous divs rather than 40,000 rows of the same height
      #   - Server-Sent events avoid sending a massive chunk of json through the network 
      # 
      # Q: Why not use a CDN for http response caching?
      # A: My company has applications which are internally hosted => a CDN would be infeasible because we arent'd istributed 

      - Developed a `daemon` process that monitors key presses and recognizes barcode syntax, triggering image capture from the warehouse CCTV system to be used as customer-facing proof of order integrity, saving over £150,000 worth of reimbursements.
      #
      # S: Customers were complaining that their orders have been missing items
      # T: We needed to prove that our warehouse employees were scanning the items and putting them in the box, 
      #   the fault is in our delivery couriers, not us.
      # A: 
      #   - barcode scanner = keyboard input, scanning = type all the characters really fast
      #   - intercept warehouse employees with keylogger, use regex to extract barcodes (products|picks)
      #   - When a barcode is recognized snap a picture
      #
      # Q: We can't store the entire video feed, too much storage requirement
      # A: only capture images when barcode gets scanned, remove images after 6 month retention period 
      #
      # Q: the barcode might be blurred on that frame, we have a pic, not clear enough 
      # A: make the camera burst fire (0.3s interval)
      #   - multiple consecutive scans = interleaving
      #   - Used asynchronous rust tasks (greenthreads)
      #   - Minor detail: keylogger is sync thread, images are async thread. Used message passing between threads
      #
      # Q: Windows/Employees could just close our program unexpectedly / Might not run on startup
      # A: Rather than configuring windows to start the program with WMS, Disguised the program to look like the WMS like a program wrapper, employees had no choice but to run the program alongside it
      # 
      # Q: what about mobile scanners
      # A: Raspberry pi implementation in bash, listen to dev input events with evtest utility, 
      # Uses raspberry pi camera not cctv camera, systemd services + fstab to connect to shared drive on system startup
      #
      # R: Misfire ratio went from 19% to 2%, 
      # Saved 100k GBP worth of reimbursements

      - Implemented semaphore-based synchronization in an asynchronous, multithreaded environment, to prevent race conditions and manage concurrent write operations.
      # Warehouse assigns a maximum number of people (N) to an order 
      # Develop an application which where only (N) employee(s) can interact with an order at once
      #   - Implemented a semaphore, gets released when the user exits the program
      #   - Code can't run after application is closed though
      #   - Loop writes to a shared storage the current timestamp + 30s (AKA: locked_until timestamp) = loop ends when application closes, releasing lock/semaphore

      - Used `cron`, the GNU coreutils, and `git` to create an automated deployment pipeline for various automated services.
      # I introduced cronjobs to my team when I joined the company. cron became our primary scheduling mechanism for automated tasks
      # Q: storing te source code of the automations quickly consumed the space on the disk
      # A: write a bash script which would pull the github repo into a tempdir, build it, and save the binary and commit hash
      #
      # Created a script which would parse the user's crontab file for all automations, updating them when the git commit hash is different between local and remote

      - Migrated from and interoperated with legacy C\# interfaces - originally created in 2003 - to modern Rust-based desktop applications, web APIs and scheduled automations.

      # Currently

      
      
      - Implemented procedural compile-time macros to enhance developer experience through abstraction, reducing the source lines of code in the overall project by 42%.
      




      - Interfaced with the `xlsxwriter` C library to programmatically generate non-trivial excel spreadsheets, such as spawning charts and extracting/including VBA macros at compile time.
      # Usual task was to parse a large file, and programmatically create an excel file from it, sending it through STMP as an email to a mailing list
      # This required more than just awk, so rust was used for this task.
      # 
      # xlsxwriter cannot modify excel, so had to parse excel, and produce a new excel from it, with all same styling
      # vba macro had to be extracted from an existing xlsm file, and then fed into the new sheet

    points: 
      - Used text-manipulation tools from the GNU coreutils such as `awk` and `sed` to process and clean existing tabular data.
      # These museum people are so old - they don't have any structure to their data. Didn't know how to use cell formats
      # Hardest task was to format the date columns to be consistent.
      #   - yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, yy-mm-dd, mm-dd yy, yyyy/mm/dd, yyyy.mm.dd
      #   - Can't just apply a cell formatting rule because unambiguous formatting 
      #   - (09/05/10) = 9th may 2010, or 10th may 2009?
      #   - initially used sed, but then needed more powerful awk
      #   - regexes with backreferences
