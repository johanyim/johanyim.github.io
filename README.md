## Experience
### Software Engineer - *BG Automotive*
> `2024-05` - `Present`
- Developed, deployed and maintained 10 containerized cloud applications optimized for resource efficiency, achieving reliable simultaneous operation on a single-core, low-tier cloud instance consuming less than 2 GB of memory running in parallel.
- Streamlined user experience by implementing stateless, secure authentication using `JWT`s stored in HTTP-only cookies, with access and refresh token rotation for session management.
- Implemented HTTP middleware in `Rust` using `Redis` as an intermediary write-back cache layer, Server-Sent Events, and frontend Virtualization/Windowing to handle payloads 600 times larger.
- Developed a `daemon` process that monitors key presses and recognizes barcode syntax, triggering image capture from the warehouse CCTV system to be used as customer-facing proof of order integrity, saving over £150,000 worth of reimbursements.
- Implemented semaphore-based synchronization in an asynchronous, multithreaded environment, to prevent race conditions and manage concurrent write operations.
- Used `cron`, the GNU coreutils, and `git` to create an automated deployment pipeline for various automated services.
- Migrated from and interoperated with legacy C# interfaces - originally created in 2003 - to modern Rust-based desktop applications, web APIs and scheduled automations.
- Implemented procedural compile-time macros to enhance developer experience through abstraction, reducing the source lines of code in the overall project by 42%.
- Interfaced with the `xlsxwriter` C library to programmatically generate non-trivial excel spreadsheets, such as spawning charts and extracting/including VBA macros at compile time.
### Volunteer Data Assistant - *Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution*
> `2024-03` - `2024-05`
- Used text-manipulation tools from the GNU coreutils such as `awk` and `sed` to process and clean existing tabular data.
## Projects
### Structure-Preserving Encryption and Decryption - *https://github.com/johanyim/spead*
- Implemented key derivation with `Argon2` algorithm to derive cryptographically strong keys to mitigate brute-force and GPU-based attacks.
- Applied Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) to encrypt and decrypt structured data without altering data formats or types, reducing the effect of encryption on data type validation.
- Combined concepts from JSON traversal/pointers with nonce selection to produce deterministic encryption, while resisting ciphertext-equality attacks.
