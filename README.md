## Experience
### Volunteer Data Assistant - *Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution*
> `2024-03` - `2024-05`
- Used text-manipulation tools from the GNU coreutils such as `awk` and `sed` to process and clean existing tabular data.
## Projects
### Structure-Preserving Encryption and Decryption - *https://github.com/johanyim/spead*
- Implemented key derivation with `Argon2` algorithm to derive cryptographically strong keys to mitigate brute-force and GPU-based attacks.
- Applied Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) to encrypt and decrypt structured data without altering data formats or types, reducing the effect of encryption on data type validation.
- Combined concepts from JSON traversal/pointers with nonce selection to produce deterministic encryption, while resisting ciphertext-equality attacks.
