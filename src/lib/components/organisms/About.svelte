        I'm Johan. I graduated from the University of Bath with a Master's
        degree in Computer Science. Right now, I'm developing software for BG
        Automotive.

        I have come to the realisation that life is too short for slow software.
        I am by no means a hyper-optimizer, and I do have a wealth of patience -
        however, the software being carelessly shovelled into the world makes me
        question if my computer's CPU was actually a defective unit.
      </p>
      <p class="py-4">
        I enjoy the long journey to make things fast - unnecessarily fast. The
        year is {new Date().getFullYear()} and we are still 'loading...' like the
        90s. I suspect that my allergy to loading spinners has been caused by the
        overwhelming growth in software complexity. At this rate, the machine you're
        using to view this site won't even run a browser for 5 minutes. So let's
        try to fix that.

        I am a minimalist. I have rid myself of unnecessary belongings and
        constructs such as furniture, social media, variety in life, and
        Windows. It is exactly for this reason that I only possess the things
        that are meaningful to me. Doing so has allowed me to lead a life free
        of complexity - albeit an abnormal one.

        I enjoy taking my time to learn new programming languages and paradigms
        through books and documentation. I strive to make apps that feel fast
        and bulletproof. Because of this, I really like using Rust for my
        projects.

        Aside from programming, I do some unhinged reviews that I post on Google
        maps.
